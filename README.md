üåç Global Guessing Game
This interactive globe-based guessing game challenges players to find a randomly selected country on Earth. Starting from Washington, D.C., players must guess the location of the hidden country by clicking on the globe. After each guess, the game shows how far the guess is from the target and provides a proximity-based color-coded line. Players have a limited number of guesses, with hints available to help guide them. If all guesses are used without success, the globe automatically zooms in and rotates to reveal the correct location.

Features:

Interactive 3D globe powered by CesiumJS
Distance feedback and color-coded proximity lines
Hints to help narrow down the target location
Auto-zoom to correct location after running out of guesses
Test your geography skills and see how close you can get!
